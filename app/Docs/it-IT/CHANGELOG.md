## 1.4.0

Initial Italian release.

### API

There are important and breaking changes coming with the next release, so if you use the Optolith source or save data, I'd recommend to come over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/wfdgB9g) so that I can tell you what is going to be changed in detail. Since more and more people depend on Optolith's data I will now follow semantic versioning strictly so that you can rely on the compatibility of source files just by checking out the version number. There will be a new format for heroes as well as for the source data. You can also give feedback on the changes, since they are not *completely* done yet &ndash; but I still think it would make sense to check out the changes as early as possible. The next major version is still a bit away, so you'll have plenty of time to adjust your software.
