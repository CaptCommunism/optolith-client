## I can't add spells or liturgical chants! That's a bug, isn't it?

It's likely because you do not meet the (following) requirements for adding spells or liturgical chants:

### Spells:

- Buy advantage *Spellcaster*.
- Buy the magical special ability *Tradition*.

### Liturgien:

* Buy advantage *Blessed One*.
* Buy the blessed special ability *Tradition*.

## How can I buy additional LP/AE/KP?

That depends on whether you are still in hero creation phase or have completed that.

* *During hero creation* you can add additional LP/AE/KP via the advantages *Increased Life Points/Arcane Power/Karma Points I-VII*. You should use them if you are interested in higher values because you can usually not buy advantages afterwards!
* *After hero creation*, to add additional LP/AE/KP, use the &raquo;+&laquo; button below the respective energy in the *Attributes* tab. The maximum values for these are calculated by using the rules from the **Core Rules p. 350&ndash;352**.
