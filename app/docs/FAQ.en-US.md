## I can't add spells or liturgical chants! That's a bug, isn't it?

It's likely because you do not meet the (following) requirements for adding spells or liturgical chants:

### Spells:

- Buy advantage *Spellcaster*.
- Buy the magical special ability *Tradition*.

### Liturgien:

* Buy advantage *Blessed One*.
* Buy the blessed special ability *Tradition*.
