# Optolith Character Generator

This is the code repository for Optolith, a desktop application for The Dark Eye 5th Edition.

## Installing

You can download the app [here (German page)](http://www.ulisses-ebooks.de/product/209711) or here [here (English page)](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220253) (same app on both pages). You'll get an installer for Windows and a DMG for Mac, both with Auto Update support. For Linux, you have to use the .tar.gz, but I am working on an Auto Updater for Linux via AppImage.

It is available for Windows 7+ as well as for Linux (Ubuntu 12.04+, Fedora 21, Debian 8) and macOS 10.9+ x64.

## Contributing

This repository only contains the code for this app, but you can the bug tracker and more at [here](https://www.github.com/Elytherion/tdeheroes).

Currently there is no need to help coding, so it would be great if you just test the app and provide feedback! But it might be in the future, please check out [respective file](CONTRIBUTING.md) then!
