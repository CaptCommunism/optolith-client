# Optolith Character Generator

This is the repository for Optolith, a desktop application for The Dark Eye 5th Edition.

## Install

You can download the app [here (German page)](http://www.ulisses-ebooks.de/product/209711) or here [here (English page)](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220253) (same app on both pages). You'll get an installer for Windows and a DMG for Mac, both with Auto Update support. For Linux, you get an AppImage, which *should* support Auto Update but it doesnt seem to work currently.

It is available for Windows 7+ as well as for Linux (Ubuntu 12.04+, Fedora 21, Debian 8) and macOS 10.9+ x64.
